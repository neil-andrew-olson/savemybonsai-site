A good bonsai soil mix is crucial for the health of your tree. It needs to provide good drainage, aeration, and water retention. While you can buy pre-mixed bonsai soil, mixing your own allows you to customize it to the specific needs of your tree.

### Common Soil Components

Here are some of the most common components used in bonsai soil mixes:

*   **Akadama**: A popular Japanese clay that is excellent for drainage and water retention.
*   **Pumice**: A volcanic rock that is lightweight and provides great aeration.
*   **Lava Rock**: Similar to pumice, it helps with drainage and aeration.
*   **Pine Bark**: Adds organic matter to the soil and helps with water retention.
