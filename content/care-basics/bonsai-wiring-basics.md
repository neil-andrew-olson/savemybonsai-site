### Why Wire a Bonsai?

*   **Shape and Style:** Wiring is the primary method for shaping your bonsai. It allows you to bend and position branches to create a specific design.
*   **Correct Growth:** You can use wire to correct branches that are growing in undesirable directions.
*   **Create Movement:** Wiring can add a sense of movement and dynamism to your bonsai's design.

### Types of Bonsai Wire

There are two main types of wire used for bonsai:

*   **Anodized Aluminum:** This wire is soft and easy to bend, making it ideal for beginners and for wiring deciduous trees.
*   **Annealed Copper:** This wire is harder than aluminum and provides a stronger hold, making it suitable for coniferous trees and for wiring thicker branches.
