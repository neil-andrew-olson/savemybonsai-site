Ficus bonsai are a popular choice for beginners due to their hardiness and ease of care. However, they still require specific care to thrive indoors. Understanding their needs and providing the right environment will ensure a healthy and beautiful bonsai.

**Light:**

Ficus bonsai need plenty of bright, indirect light. They thrive in locations with at least 4-6 hours of sunlight per day.

*   **Ideal location:** Place them near a sunny east- or west-facing window.
*   **Avoid direct sunlight:** Direct sunlight, especially during the hottest part of the day, can scorch the leaves. If you only have a south-facing window, filter the sunlight with a sheer curtain.
*   **Supplement with grow lights:** If you don't have enough natural light, you can supplement with a grow light. Use a full-spectrum LED grow light and position it 12-18 inches above the bonsai.

**Watering:**

Proper watering is crucial for ficus bonsai. Overwatering is a common mistake that can lead to root rot.

*   **Check the soil moisture:** Water your ficus bonsai when the top inch of soil is dry to the touch. Use your finger to check the soil moisture.
*   **Water thoroughly:** When you water, water thoroughly until water drains out of the bottom of the pot.
*   **Avoid overwatering:** Do not allow the bonsai to sit in standing water. Empty the saucer beneath the pot after watering.
*   **Watering frequency:** Watering frequency will vary depending on the season, temperature, and humidity. In general, you will need to water more frequently during the growing season (spring and summer) and less frequently during the dormant season (fall and winter).

**Fertilizing:**

Ficus bonsai need regular fertilization during the growing season to provide them with the nutrients they need to thrive.

*   **Use a balanced bonsai fertilizer:** Use a balanced bonsai fertilizer with an N-P-K ratio of 10-10-10 or 20-20-20.
*   **Fertilize regularly:** Fertilize your ficus bonsai every two weeks during the growing season.
*   **Reduce fertilization during the dormant season:** Reduce fertilization to once a month during the dormant season.
*   **Follow the instructions on the label:** Always follow the instructions on the fertilizer label.

**Pruning:**

Pruning is essential for maintaining the shape and health of your ficus bonsai. There are two main types of pruning: pinching and structural pruning.

*   **Pinching:** Pinching involves removing the tips of new shoots to encourage denser foliage and maintain the bonsai's shape. Use your fingers or small scissors to pinch off the tips of new shoots. Pinch back new growth regularly during the growing season.
*   **Structural Pruning:** Structural pruning involves removing larger branches to maintain the bonsai's overall shape and create a more balanced design. Prune older branches in the late winter or early spring, before new growth begins. Use sharp, sterilized pruning shears.
*   **Remove dead or diseased branches:** Remove any dead or diseased branches as soon as you notice them. This will help to prevent the spread of disease and maintain the bonsai's health.

**Temperature and Humidity:**

Ficus bonsai prefer warm temperatures between 65-75°F (18-24°C) year-round. Protect from drafts and sudden temperature changes.

*   **Humidity:** They thrive in high humidity (50-70%). Mist daily or use a humidity tray to prevent leaf drop.

**Repotting:**

Repot every 1-2 years in spring when roots fill the pot.

*   **Soil:** Use a well-draining mix like akadama, pumice, and organic matter.
*   **Root pruning:** Trim roots by about 20-30% to promote healthy growth.

**Common Problems:**

*   **[Yellowing Leaves](/problems/yellow-leaves):** Often due to overwatering, low light, or nutrient issues.
*   **Leaf Drop:** Caused by sudden environmental changes, drafts, or inconsistent watering.
*   **Brown Tips:** Indicates low humidity or fluoride in water. Use filtered water.
*   **[Spider Mites](/problems/spider-mites):** Fine webs on leaves; treat with neem oil.
*   **Scale Insects:** Sticky residue on leaves; wipe off and apply insecticidal soap.
*   **[Root Rot](/problems/root-rot):** From overwatering; repot in fresh soil if detected.

By following these care tips, you can ensure that your indoor ficus bonsai thrives and remains a beautiful addition to your home.
