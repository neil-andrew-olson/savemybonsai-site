### Light

Chinese Elm bonsai can be grown indoors or outdoors. If grown indoors, they need a bright, sunny location. If grown outdoors, they can be placed in full sun or partial shade.

### Watering

Water your Chinese Elm bonsai thoroughly when the top inch of soil is dry to the touch. They are more tolerant of underwatering than overwatering, so it is important to allow the soil to dry out slightly between waterings.

### Fertilizing

Fertilize your Chinese Elm bonsai every two weeks during the growing season (spring and summer). Use a balanced bonsai fertilizer.
