### Light

Boxwood bonsai prefer a location with partial sun. They can tolerate full sun, but the leaves may scorch in hot, direct sun.

### Watering

Water your Boxwood bonsai thoroughly when the top inch of soil is dry to the touch. They are more tolerant of underwatering than overwatering, so it is important to allow the soil to dry out slightly between waterings.

### Pruning

Boxwood bonsai respond well to pruning and can be shaped into a variety of styles. Prune your Boxwood bonsai in the spring and summer to maintain its shape.
