### Light

Chinese Sweet Plum bonsai need a lot of bright, indirect light. They can tolerate some direct morning sun, but too much direct sun can scorch the leaves.

### Watering

Water your Chinese Sweet Plum bonsai thoroughly when the top inch of soil is dry to the touch. They are not very drought-tolerant, so it is important to keep the soil consistently moist, but not waterlogged.

### Humidity

Chinese Sweet Plum bonsai appreciate high humidity. To increase the humidity around your tree, you can place it on a humidity tray or mist it regularly.
