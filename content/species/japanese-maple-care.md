### Light

Japanese Maple bonsai prefer a location with partial shade, especially in the afternoon. Too much direct sun can scorch the leaves.

### Watering

Water your Japanese Maple bonsai thoroughly when the top inch of soil is dry to the touch. They are sensitive to both overwatering and underwatering, so it is important to get the watering schedule just right.

### Humidity

Japanese Maple bonsai appreciate high humidity. To increase the humidity around your tree, you can place it on a humidity tray or mist it regularly.
