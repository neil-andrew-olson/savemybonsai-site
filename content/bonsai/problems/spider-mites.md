Spider mites are tiny pests that can cause significant damage to your bonsai if left untreated. They are difficult to see with the naked eye, but their presence can be identified by the fine webbing they create on the leaves and stems of your tree.

### Identifying a Spider Mite Infestation

*   **Fine Webbing:** The most obvious sign of a spider mite infestation is the presence of fine, silk-like webbing on the leaves and stems.
*   **Stippling on Leaves:** Spider mites feed by piercing the leaves and sucking out the cell contents, which results in tiny yellow or white spots on the leaves, known as stippling.
*   **Discolored Leaves:** As the infestation progresses, the leaves may turn yellow or bronze and eventually drop off.

### Treating a Spider Mite Infestation

1.  **Isolate Your Bonsai:** To prevent the spider mites from spreading to other plants, isolate the infested bonsai.
2.  **Wash the Foliage:** Use a strong spray of water to dislodge the spider mites and their webbing from the leaves and stems.
3.  **Apply a Miticide:** Use a miticide specifically formulated for use on bonsai trees. Follow the instructions on the label carefully.
4.  **Increase Humidity:** Spider mites thrive in dry conditions, so increasing the humidity around your bonsai can help to deter them.
