Aphids are small, sap-sucking insects that can quickly multiply and cause significant damage to your bonsai. They are often found in clusters on new growth and can be a variety of colors, including green, black, and yellow.

### Identifying an Aphid Infestation

*   **Visible Insects:** Aphids are visible to the naked eye and are often found in clusters on the undersides of leaves and on new growth.
*   **Sticky Residue:** Aphids secrete a sticky substance called honeydew, which can be found on the leaves and stems of your bonsai.
*   **Sooty Mold:** The honeydew secreted by aphids can attract a black fungus called sooty mold, which can cover the leaves and inhibit photosynthesis.
*   **Distorted Growth:** A heavy aphid infestation can cause new growth to be distorted and stunted.

### Treating an Aphid Infestation

1.  **Dislodge with Water:** Use a strong spray of water to dislodge the aphids from your bonsai.
2.  **Insecticidal Soap:** Use an insecticidal soap to kill the aphids. Be sure to follow the instructions on the label carefully.
3.  **Neem Oil:** Neem oil is a natural insecticide that can be effective against aphids.
4.  **Introduce Beneficial Insects:** Ladybugs and lacewings are natural predators of aphids and can be introduced to your garden to help control the population.
