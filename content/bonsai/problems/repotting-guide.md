# Complete Bonsai Repotting Guide

Repotting is one of the most important aspects of bonsai care. It refreshes the soil, allows root pruning, and ensures your bonsai has the nutrients and drainage it needs to thrive.

## **When to Repot Your Bonsai**

- **Deciduous trees** (Chinese Elm, Japanese Maple): Early spring, just before bud break
- **Evergreen trees** (Juniper, Pine): Late winter to early spring
- **Tropical species** (Ficus, Jade): Any time during growing season

### **Signs It's Time to Repot**
- Roots circling the pot bottom
- Water drains too quickly or too slowly
- Soil looks compacted or depleted
- Tree shows reduced growth or yellowing
- It's been 2-3 years since last repotting

## **Essential Tools & Materials**

### **Must-Have Tools**
- **Bonsai shears** for root pruning
- **Root hook** or chopstick for root teasing
- **Wire mesh** for drainage holes

## **Step-by-Step Repotting Process**

### **Step 1: Preparation (1-2 days before)**
1. **Water your bonsai thoroughly** 24 hours before repotting
2. **Prepare your workspace** with all tools and materials
3. **Select appropriate pot** (1-2 inches larger than current)

3. **Remove old soil** by gently teasing roots with root hook
4. **Inspect root system** for health and structure

### **Step 3: Root Pruning**
1. **Remove circling roots** that grow around the pot
2. **Cut away dead or rotten roots** with clean shears
3. **Reduce root mass by 1/3** for deciduous trees
4. **Reduce root mass by 1/4** for evergreen trees
5. **Apply wound sealant** to large root cuts

### **Step 4: Prepare New Pot**
1. **Cover drainage holes** with mesh screen
2. **Add layer of fresh soil** in bottom of pot
3. **Position tree** at correct angle and depth
4. **Add soil around roots** working it in gently

### **Step 5: Final Setup**
1. **Water thoroughly** to settle soil
2. **Place in shaded area** for 2-3 weeks recovery
3. **Monitor closely** for signs of stress
4. **Resume normal care** gradually

### **Ongoing Care**
- **Resume normal watering** after recovery period
- **Begin fertilizing** 4-6 weeks after repotting
- **Monitor root development** through drainage holes
- **Plan next repotting** in 2-3 years
