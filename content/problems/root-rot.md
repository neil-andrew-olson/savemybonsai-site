Root rot is a devastating condition that can quickly lead to the demise of your beloved bonsai. It's caused by prolonged exposure to overly wet conditions, creating an anaerobic environment where harmful fungi thrive and attack the root system. Early detection and prompt, decisive action are essential for saving your bonsai from this silent killer.
**Understanding Root Rot:**

*   **The Anaerobic Environment:** When the soil remains consistently waterlogged, it deprives the roots of oxygen, which is crucial for their respiration and nutrient uptake.
*   **The Fungal Culprits:** Harmful fungi, such as *Phytophthora* and *Pythium*, flourish in anaerobic conditions. These fungi attack the roots, causing them to decay and lose their ability to function.
*   **The Downward Spiral:** As the roots rot, they are unable to absorb water and nutrients, leading to a cascade of problems, including yellowing leaves, stunted growth, and ultimately, death.

**Recognizing the Symptoms:**

*   **Yellowing Leaves:** The leaves, especially older ones, may turn yellow, often starting at the tips and edges. This is a sign that the roots are unable to supply the leaves with the necessary nutrients.
*   **Stunted Growth:** The bonsai's growth rate may slow down significantly or stop altogether. New growth may be weak and sparse.
*   **Foul Odor:** A characteristic foul, musty, or rotten odor may emanate from the soil, indicating the presence of decaying organic matter.
*   **Soft, Mushy Roots:** The most definitive symptom is the state of the roots themselves. Healthy roots are firm and light-colored. Affected roots will be soft, mushy, brown or black, and easily break apart.

**Taking Action: Treating Root Rot:**

1.  **Remove the Bonsai from Its Pot:** Gently remove the bonsai from its pot, being careful not to damage the remaining healthy roots.
2.  **Inspect the Roots:** Carefully examine the root system, noting the extent of the damage.
3.  **Trim the Affected Roots:** Using sterilized root cutters or scissors, carefully trim away all dead, mushy, or discolored roots. Cut back to healthy tissue.
4.  **Repot the Bonsai in Fresh Soil:** Use a well-draining bonsai soil mix that is appropriate for your bonsai species. Avoid using the old soil, as it may be contaminated with fungal spores.
5.  **Apply a Fungicide:** Drench the soil with a systemic fungicide to kill any remaining fungal spores. Follow the instructions on the fungicide label carefully.
6.  **Adjust Your Watering Schedule:** Allow the soil to dry slightly between waterings. Monitor the soil moisture carefully and adjust your watering schedule accordingly.
7.  **Provide Optimal Growing Conditions:** Ensure that the bonsai is receiving adequate light and air circulation.

**Preventing Root Rot:**

*   **Use a Well-Draining Soil Mix:** Choose a bonsai soil mix that is designed for good drainage.
*   **Water Properly:** Water your bonsai only when the top inch of soil is dry to the touch.
*   **Ensure Adequate Drainage:** Make sure the pot has several drainage holes at the bottom.
*   **Provide Good Air Circulation:** Ensure that the bonsai is receiving good air circulation.
*   **Monitor Your Bonsai Regularly:** Inspect your bonsai regularly for any signs of root rot or other problems.

By understanding the causes of root rot, recognizing the symptoms, and taking prompt action, you can save your bonsai from this deadly condition and ensure its continued health and beauty.
